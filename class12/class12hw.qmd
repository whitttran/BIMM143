## CLASS12 HW

Section 4: Population Scale Analysis.
One sample is obviously not enought to know what is happening in a population. You are interested in assessing genetic differences on a population scale. 

## Q.13

```{r}
expr <- read.table("rs8067378_ENSG00000172057.6.txt")

table(expr$geno)

```

The sample size for A/A is 108, for A/G is 233, and G/G is 121.

```{r}
aa <- expr[expr$geno == "AA"]

table(aa$exp)

```


## Q.14

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(expr) +aes(geno, exp, fill=geno) + geom_boxplot(notch=TRUE)
```

Yes, the SNP affects the expression of ORMDL3. Having G/G appears to be associated with a reduced expression of the gene whereas having A/A is associated with higher expression of ORMDL3. Being heterozygous (A/G) is between these two expression levels.
