Here we analyze a candy dataset from the 538 website. This is a CSV file from their GitHub repository.

## Data Import

```{r}
candy <- read.csv("candy-data.txt", row.names=1)
head(candy)
```

>Q1. How many different candy types are in this dataset?

```{r}
nrow(candy)
```

>Q2. How many fruity candy are in the dataset?

```{r}
sum(candy$fruity)
```

>Q3. What is your favorite candy in the dataset and what is it’s winpercent value?

```{r}
candy["Twix", ]$winpercent
```

>Q4. What is the winpercent value for “Kit Kat”?

```{r}
candy["Kit Kat", ]$winpercent
```

>Q5. What is the winpercent value for “Tootsie Roll Snack Bars”?

```{r}
candy["Tootsie Roll Snack Bars", ]$winpercent
```

>Q. What is the least liked candy in the dataset - lowest winpercent?

```{r}
inds <- order(candy$winpercent)
candy[inds,]
```

```{r}
#install.packages("skimr")
```

```{r}
library("skimr")
skim(candy)
```


>Q6. Is there any variable/column that looks to be on a different scale to the majority of the other columns in the dataset?

- the winpercent is on a different scale.

>Q7. What do you think a zero and one represent for the candy$chocolate column?

- The zero and one represents if it is true/false in terms of chocolate.


>Q8. Plot a histogram of winpercent values

```{r}

hist(candy$winpercent, breaks=8)
```



>Q9. Is the distribution of winpercent values symmetrical?

- The distribution of winpercent values is not symmetrical.

>Q10. Is the center of the distribution above or below 50%?

- The center of distribution is below 50%.


>Q11. On average is chocolate candy higher or lower ranked than fruit candy?

```{r}
mean(candy$winpercent[as.logical(candy$chocolate)])

mean(candy$winpercent[as.logical(candy$fruity)])
```

- Chocolate is higher ranked than fruit candy.

>Q12. Is this difference statistically significant?

```{r}
t.test(candy$winpercent[as.logical(candy$chocolate)],candy$winpercent[as.logical(candy$fruity)])


```

- They are statistically significant.


>Q13. What are the five least liked candy types in this set?


```{r}
head(candy[order(candy$winpercent),],n=5)
```

>Q14. What are the top 5 all time favorite candy types out of this set?

```{r}
tail(candy[order(candy$winpercent),], n=5)
```


>Q15. Make a first barplot of candy ranking based on winpercent values.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, rownames(candy)) +
  geom_col()
```

>Q16. This is quite ugly, use the reorder() function to get the bars sorted by winpercent?

```{r}

ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, reorder(rownames(candy),winpercent)) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(x="Win Percent", y=NULL)

ggsave('barplot1.png', width=7, height=10)
```

```{r}
#![](barplot1.png)
```


You can insert any image using this markdown syntax.

Add some color to our ggplot. We neede to make a custom color vector.

```{r}
#start with all black vector of coors
my_cols = rep("black", nrow(candy))
my_cols[as.logical(candy$choclate)] = "chocolate"
my_cols[as.logical(candy$bar)] = "brown"
my_cols[as.logical(candy$fruity)] = "red"


ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, reorder(rownames(candy),winpercent)) +
  geom_col(fill=my_cols) +
  labs(x="Win Percent", y=NULL)
```


>Q17. What is the worst ranked chocolate candy?

- Charleston Chew

>Q18. What is the best ranked fruity candy?

- skittles 

#Taking a look at pricepercent

```{r}
candy$pricepercent
```


If we want to see what is a good candy to buy in terms of win percent and pricepercent we can plot these two variables ad then see the best candy for the least amount of money.

```{r}
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, pricepercent, label=rownames(candy)) +
  geom_point(col=my_cols) +
  geom_text()
```


To avoid the overplotting of all these abels we can use an add on package called ggrepel.

```{r}
#install.packages("ggrepel")
```


```{r}
library(ggrepel)

ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, pricepercent, label=rownames(candy)) +
  geom_point(col=my_cols) +
  geom_text_repel(max.overlaps=10, col=my_cols)
```



>Q19. Which candy type is the highest ranked in terms of winpercent for the least money - i.e. offers the most bang for your buck?

- I would say Reese's Miniatures offer the most bang for your buck.




>Q20. What are the top 5 most expensive candy types in the dataset and of these which is the least popular?

```{r}
ord <- order(candy$pricepercent, decreasing=TRUE)
head(candy[ord, c(11,12)], n=5)
```

- Nik L Nip, Ring pop, Nestle Smarties, Hersheys Krackel, Hersheys Milk Chocolate
- Nik L Nip is the least popular

#5 Exploring the correlation structure

```{r}
#install.packages("corrplot")
```

```{r}
library(corrplot)

cij<- cor(candy)

corrplot(cij)
```

>Q22. Examining this plot what two variables are anti-correlated (i.e. have minus values)?

- fruit and chocolate are anti-correlated.

>Q23. Similarly, what two variables are most positively correlated?

- chocolate and bar are most positively correlated.

#On to PCA

The main function for this is called `prcomp()` and here we know we need to scale our data with the `scale=TRUE` argument.

```{r}
pca <- prcomp(candy, scale=TRUE)
summary(pca)
```

Plot my main PCA score plot with ggplot.

```{r}
#Make a new data frame with our PCA results and candy data
my_data <- cbind(candy, pca$x[,1:3])
```

```{r}
ggplot(my_data) +
  aes(PC1, PC2, label=rownames(candy)) +
  geom_point(col=my_cols) +
  geom_text_repel(col=my_cols) + 
  labs(x="PC1", y="PC2")
```

## loadings plot

```{r}
loadings <- as.data.frame(pca$rotation)

ggplot(loadings) +
  aes(PC1, reorder(rownames(loadings), PC1)) +
  geom_col()
```


```{r}
plot(pca$x[,1:2])
```


```{r}
par(mar=c(8,4,2,2))
barplot(pca$rotation[,1], as=2, ylab="PC1 Contribution")
```

>Q24. What original variables are picked up strongly by PC1 in the positive direction? Do these make sense to you?

- Variables such as fruity, hard, and pluribus are picked up strongly by PC1 in the positive direction. This makes sense if chocolate is normally well-liked, but people who like fruity, hard, and pluribus will influence the data.
